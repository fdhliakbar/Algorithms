# What are Algorithms and Data Structures in Programming

Algorithm is a sequence of logical steps that must be followed to complete a task or problem. In programming, algorithms are used to design effective and efficient programs. Algorithms allow programmers to solve problems in a systematic way, and produce programs that are easier to understand and maintain. 

A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in computer memory. Data structures are used in programming to allow programs to store and access data more efficiently. Examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, and trees. By using the right data structure, programs can perform operations more quickly and efficiently.

When designing a program, it is important to consider both of these things. By using the right algorithms and efficient data structures, programs can be made better and faster.

## Workflow for learning algorithms and data structures:

- Start by learning the basics of programming  such as variables, data types, operators, and control structures.
- Learn the concept of algorithms and how to design effective and efficient algorithms.
- Learn data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
-  Learn how to implement data structures in programming.
- Learn different types of algorithms such as search algorithms, sort algorithms, and graph algorithms.
- Learn how to optimize the performance of algorithms and data structures.
- Keep practicing and working on more difficult programming challenges to improve your skills.

By following this workflow, **you will build a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures** that will help you become a more effective and efficient programmer. Have a good study.
