## How String is Represented in memory

In C, a string can be referred to either using a character pointer or as a character array. When strings are declared as character arrays, they are stored like other types of arrays in C. For example, if str[] is an auto variable then the string is stored in the stack segment, if itâ€™s a global or static variable then stored in the data segment, etc.
